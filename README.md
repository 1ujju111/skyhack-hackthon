The Call Center Optimization Tool is designed to enhance the efficiency of call center operations by analyzing key metrics such as Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST). The project involves developing a Python application using pandas and Tkinter that allows users to upload and analyze call center data to identify inefficiencies and propose solutions.

Key Components:
Data Collection and Integration:

The tool collects and merges multiple datasets, including call details, sentiment scores, customer information, and call reasons.
Data Analysis:

It calculates AHT and AST for each call, analyzes the most and least frequent call reasons, and evaluates patterns in the data.
The tool quantifies the impact of these call reasons on call center performance and identifies opportunities for improvement.
Recommendations:

Based on the analysis, the tool provides actionable recommendations, such as:
Enhancing the IVR system to automate routine tasks and reduce AHT.
Implementing NLP for improved call routing and efficiency.
Optimizing agent scheduling based on call volume and sentiment data.
Monitoring agent performance for targeted training.
Results and Impact:

The tool helps businesses understand the drivers behind long call times and provides a data-driven approach to optimizing call center processes.
By implementing these strategies, companies can reduce call durations, minimize customer wait times, and improve overall customer satisfaction.
